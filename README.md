Data is more powerful when we share it with others! Let's take what we've learned about HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the analysis we've done.

#Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude
For this homework we'll be creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past assignment. Specifically, we'll be plotting weather data.

In building this dashboard, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

#Website
The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

A landing page containing:
With an explanation of the project.
Links to each visualizations page with a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image takes the user to that visualization.
Four visualization pages, each with:
A descriptive title and heading tag.
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
A "Comparisons" page that:
Contains all of the visualizations on the same page making it easy to visually compare them.
A "Data" page that:
A responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
